## Galaxy Brain ðŸŒŒ: 100x NLP Dev+Deploy projects

Do you spend more time wrestling with broken environments, complex builds, and deployment scripts than you do on actual NLP innovation? We live in a world of duct tape and compromises:
- The "Two-Body Problem": Your code lives in Git, but your models and datasets are loosely-referenced artifacts, leading to versioning chaos and non-reproducible builds.
- Environment Hell: Hours lost trying to replicate a teammate's setup, battling conflicting dependencies, and debugging pip or conda failures, especially with compiled libraries like tokenizers.
- The Deployment Chasm: The path from a trained model to a hardware-accelerated production endpoint is a manual, error-prone journey of optimization, containerization, and CI/CD gymnastics.

What if there was a better way? What if you could have a development experience that was easier, a training and deployment pipeline that was uv-style faster, and a system where versioning data and models was trivial?

Introducing Galaxy Brain ðŸŒŒ. A unified, hermetic architecture that transforms how you build, train, and deploy state-of-the-art NLP systems.

Galaxy Brain is not just another library; it's a complete, production-ready system built on a constellation of best-in-class tools. It integrates the industrial strength of spaCy and the vast ecosystem of Hugging Face into a single, cohesive monorepo, orchestrated by a "bulletproof" build system. It combines the blazing-fast developer tooling of Astral's uv, the robust compilation of meson-python, and the hermetic orchestration of Bazel, all designed for seamless deployment to a universe of accelerated hardware, including world-class providers like Cerebras.

### How It Works: From Local Dev to Production in a Single Command
Galaxy Brain redesigns the entire NLP workflow around a single source of truth: a hermetic build graph.
- Blazing-Fast Setup (Seconds, not Hours): Onboard a new project or developer with two commands: uv venv and uv pip install. uv's Rust-based performance makes environment setup instantaneous.
- Bulletproof, Reproducible Builds: We've replaced fragile, imperative build scripts with meson-python for robust Cython/C++ compilation and Bazel for hermetic orchestration. Every build is sandboxed and 100% reproducible, eliminating "works on my machine" errors forever.
- Code, Data, and Models as One: The "two-body problem" is solved. With a custom hf_repository rule, Hugging Face models and datasets become version-locked, build-time dependencies, just like any other piece of code. Fine-tuning a model is no longer a manual process; it's a reproducible build target.
- Effortless Deployment to Accelerated Hardware: Go from source code to a production-ready container optimized for hardware like Cerebras's Wafer-Scale Engines with a single Bazel command. Our architecture integrates hardware optimization toolkits like Hugging Face Optimum directly into the build graph, abstracting away the complexity of targeting specific accelerators.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Building a Specialized Information Extractor (e.g., for Legal Contracts) | Manually chain together PDF parsers, custom regex scripts, and a spaCy NER model. Struggle to manage the different components and their dependencies. Evaluation is a separate, manual process.                              | Define the entire pipelineâ€”from PDF ingestion to a custom-trained spaCy NER component and rule-based matchersâ€”in a single, version-controlled Pydantic config. The entire extraction pipeline is a single, testable, and deployable Bazel artifact.                                     |
| Deploying a Sentiment Analysis API                                       | Find a sentiment analysis model on the Hub. Write a Flask/FastAPI wrapper. Manually build a Docker container. Write separate CI/CD scripts to deploy it. Hope the production environment matches your local setup.           | Declare the Hugging Face sentiment model as a dependency in MODULE.bazel. The entire application, including the model and API server, is defined as a container_image target. Run bazel build //:sentiment_api_container to get a minimal, reproducible, production-ready container.    |
| Creating a Multi-Component NLP Workflow (e.g., Summarize then Classify)  | Write a script that first calls a summarization model, then passes the output to a classification model. Manage two separate model dependencies and their versions manually. Difficult to optimize the end-to-end flow.      | Define a hybrid pipeline in a single config file, referencing a Hugging Face summarization component and a spaCy text classification component. Galaxy Brain manages the data flow and dependencies, and the entire multi-step workflow can be optimized and deployed as a single unit. |
| Fine-Tuning a Transformer                                                | Manually download data. Create a messy notebook. pip install a dozen packages. Hope the environment doesn't break. Track the resulting model weights in a spreadsheet or with a vague filename.                              | Define your base model and dataset as version-locked dependencies in a MODULE.bazel file. Run bazel build //models:my_finetuned_model. The output is a hermetic, versioned, and perfectly reproducible model artifact.                                                                  |
| Collaborating with a Team                                                | Send a long README with 20 setup steps. Spend hours on calls debugging why a new teammate's build is failing. Discover your production model was trained with a slightly different dependency version, invalidating results. | git clone. uv venv. uv pip install. bazel test //.... The entire process is guaranteed to work identically for every developer and in CI, because the build is hermetic and fully defined in the repository.                                                                            |

### The Promise
- Easier: We've abstracted the immense complexity of the modern NLP stack. What used to be dozens of manual steps and multiple tools is now a single, declarative command. You focus on your model's logic, not the plumbing.
- Developer Time: uv and Bazel's caching provide near-instantaneous feedback loops for setup, builds, and tests.
- Compute Time: The seamless, automated path to hardware-accelerated providers like Cerebras means your models run at maximum speed in production without a complex MLOps effort.

Trivial Versioning: By treating data and models as first-class citizens in the build graph, versioning becomes automatic and foolproof. Every artifact is immutably tied to the exact code, data, and configuration that produced it.

It's time to stop fighting your tools and start building the future of NLP.

#### How the Tools Fit Together

- Bazel (The Orchestrator): Bazel is the backbone of the monorepo.
- The root MODULE.bazel file declares all external dependencies, such as spacy, transformers, and the specific versions of their models from the Hugging Face Hub. This ensures every developer and CI run uses the exact same versions.
- BUILD.bazel files in each directory define buildable units ("targets"). For example, apps/api_service/BUILD.bazel would define a container_image target that depends on the py_library target from packages/nlp_utils.
- Bazel's dependency graph means that if you change a file in nlp_utils, it knows to only re-test and re-build the api_service and any other app that depends on it, making CI incredibly fast and efficient.
- uv (The Developer's Cockpit): uv provides the fast and familiar "outer shell" for local development.
- A developer clones the repo and runs uv venv and uv pip install to instantly create a consistent environment with all necessary tools like ruff, mypy, and bazelisk.
- This provides a frictionless onboarding experience while Bazel handles the hermetic "inner shell" for all official builds and tests.
- meson-python (The Compilation Engine): For high-performance custom components written in Cython (e.g., a custom spaCy component in packages/nlp_utils), meson-python acts as the build backend.
- Bazel is configured to invoke meson-python to compile these components reliably and declaratively. This abstracts away the complexity of C/C++ compilation from the developer.

This structure allows teams to share code effortlessly, enforce standards centrally, and manage dependencies with confidence, creating a truly scalable and reproducible foundation for building production-grade NLP applications.
