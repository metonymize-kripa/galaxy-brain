Subject: URGENT: Widget-X completely broken, customers are complaining!

Hi Support Team,

I'm writing to report a critical issue with Widget-X that's affecting multiple customers. The system has been down for over 2 hours and we're getting angry calls from clients.

Customer complaints include:
- Login failures
- Data not syncing
- Error messages showing "Service Unavailable"

This is completely unacceptable! We need this fixed immediately or we risk losing major accounts like TechCorp and DataSystems Inc.

Please escalate this to your highest priority support team.

Best regards,

Subject: Question about billing for Premium Plan

Hello,

I have a question about my recent billing statement. I was charged $299 for the Premium Plan, but I thought I was on the Standard Plan at $99/month.

Could you please help clarify this? I'd like to understand what services are included in the Premium Plan and if this charge is correct.

My account details:
- Customer ID: C67890
- Email: mike.chen@startup.com
- Company: StartupCorp

Thanks for your help!

Subject: Feature request and positive feedback

Hi there,

I just wanted to reach out and say how much I love using your Analytics Dashboard! The new reporting features you added last month have been incredibly helpful for our team.

I do have one small feature request - would it be possible to add export functionality for the quarterly reports? It would make our client presentations much easier.

Keep up the great work!

Best,
